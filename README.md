# postgresql-many-to-many
In systems analysis, a Many-to-Many relationship occurs between two Entities when a One-to-Many relationship between them works both ways:

An element of A may be linked to many elements of B.
A member of B may be linked to many elements of A.

For example, assume that you want to design a Movie Blog data models,
you can think about one Movie has many Actors, and one Actor can point to many Movies.
